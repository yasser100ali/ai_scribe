# Healthcare AI Chat - DeepScribe Project

An AI-powered healthcare documentation system built for DeepScribe, featuring a dual-interface design that serves both medical professionals and patients.

## 🚀 Features

### Dual Interface System

#### Medical Professional Interface
- **Patient Record Queries**: Healthcare providers can ask the AI questions about patient records, medical histories, and treatment plans
- **Conversation History Access**: Review previous patient-AI interactions and symptom discussions
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Get AI-powered insights and recommendations based on patient data
- **Secure Access**: HIPAA-compliant access to patient information and interaction logs

#### Patient Interface
- **Symptom Assessment**: Patients can describe their symptoms in natural conversation
- **AI-Guided Consultation**: The AI asks relevant follow-up questions similar to what a doctor or nurse would ask
- **24/7 Availability**: Patients can get preliminary health assessments anytime
- **Secure Data Sharing**: Patient interactions are securely stored and accessible to healthcare providers
- Idea here is to build upon the data so the AI systems and medical professional can know more about their patients. If the patient seems to have a potentially serious condition based on their conversation, there could also be an auto-appointment or urge for them to call 911 while their healthcare provider is notified. 

### Shared Capabilities
- **Unified Data Access**: Medical professionals can access patient-AI conversation histories for comprehensive care
- **Intelligent Triage**: AI helps identify urgent cases and appropriate care levels
- **Documentation Automation**: Automatic generation of clinical notes from patient interactions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
